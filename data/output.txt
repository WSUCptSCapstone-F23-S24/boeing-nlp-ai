83 5 Background: The Boeing 737
The Boeing corporation developed the 737 in the mid-1960s to serve as a lower-cost twin-engined, short- range companion to the larger 727 and 707 models.
Production of the original variant (designated 100) began in 1966, with capacity for 85 passengers, five-abreast seating, and powered by two Pratt & Whitney JT8D-15 low-bypass turbofan engines, situated beneath the wings.
A slightly larger model 200 followed in 1967, with increased thrust to compensate for additional weight.
In 1984, Boeing introduced the first of three variants that would subsequently be designated “Classics”.
These were the 300, 400 and 500 series.
The new models were heavily revised, and featured winglets for increased lift and range, and CFM International CFM56-3C-1 high-bypass turbofan engines.
Modifications to the landing gear to incorporate the larger engines was required.
The ‘Classics’ were larger, quieter and more economical, and also featured EFIS CRT avionics, replacing conventional instrumentation.
In 1998, Boeing again heavily revised the 737, with the 600, 700, 800 and 900 variants, designated ‘NG’ (Next Generation).
These aircraft featured FADEC controlled CFM56-7 high-bypass turbofan engines, larger and more efficient wings (without winglets in some cases), a strengthened fuselage, revised avionics, and a higher cruise speed.
In 2016 (as a response to the Airbus A320 NEO), Boeing introduced the ‘MAX’ series – designated MAX-7, MAX-8, MAX-9, MAX- 10, MAX-200.
The MAX-8 was the first to enter service – in 2017.
The MAX variants offer four lengths, with options for 138 to 230 seats and a range of between 3,215 and 3,825 nautical miles.
These aircraft are equipped with split winglets and powered by the CFM International LEAP high-bypass turbofan engines.
The Boeing 737 (all variants including military and cargo not discussed above) is the highest-selling commercial jetliner in history, with over 10,000 deliveries as of 2018.

The X-Plane B737-800 Unlike other flight simulators, X- Plane employs a technique called “blade element theory.
This utilizes the actual shape of the aircraft (as modeled in the simulator) and breaks down the forces on each part separately.
The force of the “air” acting on each component of the model is individually calculated, and combined, to produce extremely realistic flight.
When you “fly” an airplane in X- Plane, there are no artificial rules in place to govern how the aircraft behaves.
Your control inputs move the control surfaces of the aircraft, and these interact with the virtual flow of air around it.
As such, you may consider that you are really flying the aircraft.
Due to the use of ‘Blade Element Theory’ in X-Plane, an aircraft must be modeled with great accuracy, in order that it behave like its real-life counterpart.
This means the fuselage, wings and tail surfaces must be the right size and shape, the center of lift and center of gravity must be in the right places, and the engine(s) must develop the right amount of power.
In fact, there are a great many properties that must be modeled correctly to achieve a high-fidelity flight model.
The 737-800 featured in X-Plane-11 has been modeled by our design team with a degree of accuracy that ensures its flight characteristics are like the real aircraft.
However, despite this, some differences will be apparent, because even the smallest factor plays into the ultimate behavior of the aircraft, both in real life, and in X-Plane.
The systems modeling of this aircraft involves some compromise too, because of the degree of complexity present in the real aircraft.
However, in most cases, the actual 737-800 procedures could be followed when operating the X-Plane version.
Checklists are presented later in this document (with modifications to suit this specific simulation platform and model).
It is recommended that X-Plane pilots follow those procedures to extract the maximum capability and enjoyment from this aircraft.
8 Views and Controls The X-Plane B737-800 features a detailed 3-D cockpit with a great many of the primary controls and systems modeled, including: Flight controls (yoke, rudder pedals, thrust levers, prop levers, condition levers), electrical systems, pneumatic systems, navigation aids, radios, autopilot, interior and exterior lighting, and fuel systems.
Hint: To best view some of the switches featured in this aircraft, it is helpful to hide the pilot and co-pilot yokes.
This can be accomplished selecting “Joystick and Equipment” from the “Settings” menu, and assigning a button, or key, to the following: Operation | Toggle Yoke Visibility (The default keyboard assignment is ‘y’).
Use the assigned button/key to toggle the yoke view as required.
This will have no effect on the yoke operation.
9 Creating “Quick Look” views Before discussing the controls, we suggest that the pilot establish a series of “Quick Look” views that will be helpful later when interacting with this particular aircraft.
If you are not familiar with this technique, more information is available in the X-Plane Desktop Manual.
The following “Quick Look” views are recommended for the B737-800, in a situation where the pilot is not using a Virtual Reality (VR) headset, or a head tracking device.
To some degree, these correspond (on the keyboard Number Pad) with their physical locations in the cockpit, and are therefore logical and easy to recall later.

Control Panel Engine Instrument Panel / Autopilot Panel Co-Pilot’s EFIS (Electronic Flight Instrument System) Control Panel 11 Pilot’s Left Glance View Overhead Panel Co-Pilot’s
Right Glance View 12 Operating the controls This section covers the basics techniques for the operation of the controls that you will encounter in the cockpit of an X-Plane aircraft.
Control manipulators are consistent across all X-Plane 11 aircraft.
However, the specific ILLUSTRATIONS in THIS chapter may differ from YOUR aircraft.
Toggle and Rocker switches are operated with a single click of the mouse.
Place the mouse pointer slightly above, or below, the center point of the switch, depending on the direction you intend to move it.
A small white arrow is displayed to confirm the intended direction.
Click the mouse button to complete the operation.
Levers are operated by assigning a peripheral device to the necessary axes in X-Plane (throttle, prop, mixture etc.).
More information is available in the X-Plane Desktop Manual.
Levers may also be operated by clicking and dragging the mouse pointer.
Some rotary dials are operated by positioning the mouse pointer on top of the control, and then a click and drag to the right, or to the left.
The same can be accomplished using the mouse wheel - if one is present on your device.
Other rotary controls require finer precision.
When the mouse pointer is positioned slightly to the left of such a control, a counter-clockwise arrow appears.
This indicates that you are ready to rotate the control counter-clockwise.
Correspondingly, a clockwise arrow indicates that you are ready to rotate the control clockwise.
After positioning the mouse pointer, changing the frequency in the desired direction is accomplished in two ways: i) By rolling the mouse wheel forwards, or backwards ii) By clicking (dragging is not supported here)
Radio and Navigation frequency rotary dials are grouped together as “twin concentric knobs”.
Here, the larger rotary is used to tune the integer portion of the frequency, and the smaller rotary is used to tune the decimal portion.
Each works independently, using the same technique, as described above.
13 Push buttons are operated by pointing and clicking with the mouse.
Guarded switches are used in situations where accidental activation of the switch must be prevented.
To operate a guarded switch, the guard must first be opened.
Do this by positioning the mouse pointer over the switch until the two vertical white arrows are displayed.
Click once.
If the switch is currently closed, it will open, and vice- versa.
After the guard has been opened, the switch may be operated like a toggle and rocker switch (see earlier in this section).
The Yoke / Stick / Joystick is operated by assigning a peripheral device to the “roll” and “pitch” axes in X-Plane.
This is discussed in greater detail later in the guide.
The Rudder Pedals are operated by assigning a peripheral device to the “yaw” axis in X-Plane.
If your rudders also support toe braking, create additional assignments to the “left toe brake” and “right toe brake” axes in X-Plane.
This is discussed in greater detail later in the guide.
Note that you may also assign keys on your keyboard, or buttons on your external peripheral to move the rudder to the left or right, or to center the rudder.
14 Assigning peripheral devices This section of the manual deals with an “ideal” scenario, in terms of the assignment of external computer peripherals to operate the X-Plane B737-800 with the highest degree of realism.
If you are missing some of these external peripherals, you may elect to choose a different configuration that better suits your hardware.
The B737-800 is equipped with Yokes, for roll and pitch control.
To simulate this, assign the lateral axis of your yoke (or joystick) to the “Roll” command in X-Plane, and the vertical axis to the “Pitch” command.
More information is available in the X-Plane Desktop Manual.
The B737-800 is equipped with dual thrust levers – which control the thrust generated by the left and right engines respectively.
To simulate the thrust levers for a B737-800, assign two levers on your quadrant to the “Throttle 1” and “Throttle 2” property in X-Plane.
The B737-800 is equipped with a “Fuel Flow lever” for each engine.
These are manually actuated by the flight crew to introduce fuel to the engines during the start procedure.
To simulate this, assign two levers on your quadrant to the “Mixture 1” and “Mixture 2” properties in X-Plane. .
15
The B737-800 is equipped with a Flap lever, which controls the deployment of the flaps for takeoff and landing.
To simulate this, assign a peripheral lever to the “Flaps” property in X-Plane. .
The B737-800 is equipped with a Landing Gear lever.
To simulate this, assign a peripheral lever to the “Landing gear” property in X-Plane. .
The B737-800 has conventional rudder controls, actuated by the rudder pedals.
The pedals activate the rudder, which is part of the tail assembly, and this “yaws” the aircraft to the left or right.
The rudders keep the aircraft straight during takeoff and landing, and help make coordinated turns.
To simulate this, assign the yaw axis of your pedals peripheral device (or a joystick axis) to the “yaw” property in X-Plane.
16
The B737-800 has rudder toe-braking, actuated by the tip of the rudder pedals.
To simulate this, assign the brake “toe-tipping” motion of each individual pedal (or a joystick axis) to the “left toe brake” and “right toe brake” property in X-Plane.
17 A Tour of the Cockpit In this section of the manual, the cockpit will be broken down into distinct functional areas, and the controls that are featured in those areas will be identified and described.
This will assist in locating the necessary instruments and controls later, when working through the aircraft check lists, and flying the aircraft.
Forward Overhead Panel
The forward overhead panel comprises a collection of smaller panels that manage the aircraft’s electrical, pneumatic, lighting, pressurization, engine start, and other systems.
Many of these were previously the domain of a flight engineer in the era of three- person flight crews.
Note: Not all of the functions contained within these panels are fully simulated in the X-Plane 737-800 model.
18 1.
Flight Controls This panel is used to select the active flight control systems (rudder, flaps, spoilers, and features a yaw damper toggle switch.
In the X-Plane model of the 737-800, this panel supports only the Yaw Damper toggle switch.
2. AC and DC Metering This panel is used to select and monitor the source of electrical power to the aircraft (both DC on the left, and AC on the right.
It also features the master battery switch.
19 3. Transfer This panel is used to control the active navigation devices, in the event of a failure.
If either Nav Radio receiver / Inertial Reference System / Flight Management Computer fails, the associated control switches on this panel may be used to transfer the remaining (good) system to both pilot and first-officer in unison.
In Normal mode, these systems may be used independently by the pilot and first-officer.
The SOURCE Rotary is used on the ground for maintenance purposes.
The CONTROL PANEL Rotary manually switches control of left and right-side displays to a single EFIS control panel.
In the X-Plane model of the 737-800, this panel supports only the VHF NAV switch.
4. Standby Power & Generator Bus This panel controls the standby electrical buses (AUTO, BAT or OFF).
AUTO is the normal mode and will engage the battery standby electrical buses (via a relay), automatically when needed.
BAT - forces manual transfer to the standby electrical buses.
OFF - standby electrical buses are not powered.
The Disconnect switches remove the left or right generators from providing power to the electrical buses – in the event of a failure of the corresponding generator.
The GRD PWR switch engages the use of ground electrical power (via an umbilical cable) if this is available.
The BUS TRANSFER switch controls the automated transfer of power to the remaining good generator, in the event of a failure of the other generator.
The GEN 1 and GEN 2 switches activate the main electrical generators which are fed from the engines (when running).
The APU GEN 1 and APU GEN 2 switches activate the Auxiliary Power Unit electrical generators.
These are powered by the APU turbine at the rear of the aircraft, which is a preliminary source of power prior to engine start.
20 5.
Fuel This panel controls the fuel flow and fuel pumps.
The Fuel Temp gauge reports the temperature of the fuel in tank #1.
Fuel is heated using the engine oil, to minimize icing potential.
The lower portion of this panel is arranged schematically, and the fuel pump switches represent the actual location of the pumps in the aircraft.
These switches control the fuel pumps for tanks 1 (left), 2 (right), and the center tank.
The cross-feed rotary opens or closes the cross-feed valve.
When open, either of the engines may source fuel from any tank.
Under normal circumstances, the left engine is fed by the left, and center tanks, and the right engine by the right and center tanks.
6. APU and Engine start / External Lights This panel supports two main functions: APU and Engine start, and control of the external taxi, runway, and collision lights.
Starting the APU is accomplished by holding the switch in the START position for a few seconds, then releasing back to the ON position.
APU shut-down is accomplished by moving this switch to the OFF position.
The engine ignition system in use is controlled by the switch located between the two engine start rotaries.
There are two independent ignition systems, which may be used in isolation (LEFT or RIGHT), or together (BOTH) Engine start is accomplished by turning the left or right engine rotary control to GND until the start sequence has been completed (covered in detail in the checklists later in this guide).
Once the engine has been started, this switch is normally set to AUTO, However, in the event of sever precipitation, turbulence or icing, these switches should be set to CONT (continuous use of selected igniter) or FLT (continuous use of both igniters).
This prevents a possible engine flame-out.
The external landing lights are controlled by the switches at the left side of this panel.
The two left-most switches control the (wing) outboard lights, and the two right-most the (wing) inboard lights.
The anti-collision lights are controlled by the switches at the right side of this panel.
21 7.
Ice & Rain Protection
This panel is used to control the window and pitot tube heaters, to protect against fogging and icing.
Switches at the top of this panel are provided to activate the left-side and forward window heaters, the right-side and forward window heaters, and the two-external pitot-tube heaters (A and B).
Switches at the bottom of this panel are provided for the wing (electrical) anti-ice, and engine intake anti-ice heaters.
8.
Temperature Control
This panel monitors and controls the cabin temperature.
The rotary control at the top-right is used to select the region of the cabin to be monitored, with the associated temperature being displayed by the gauge to at the upper-left.
The three rotary controls at the lower portion of the panel set the temperature of (left to right) the flight deck, forward cabin, and aft cabin.
22 9.
Pneumatics This panel controls the aircraft pneumatic system, which can be supplied by the engines, APU or a ground source.
The pneumatic system provides air for engine starting, air conditioning packs and the wing anti- ice boots.
The DUCT PRESSURE gauge displays the available air pressure in the left, and right pneumatic systems.
The recirculating fans recirculate filtered air back to the cabin, to reduce bleed air requirements.
The LEFT PACK and RIGHT PACK switches direct bleed air to the air-conditioning packs, for cabin environmental control.
The isolation valve is used to isolate the left and right pneumatic systems.
When set to AUTO, this valve opens and closes automatically, as required by the pneumatic systems.
When set to CLOSE, the left and right pneumatic system operate independently.
The Wing Anti-ice switches direct bleed air to the left and right de-icing boots at the leading edge of the wings.
When the APU Bleed switch is on, the pneumatic system is pressurized using bleed air from the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU).
This is a small (internal) turbine located at the rear of the aircraft.
10.
Hydraulics Pressure to the two hydraulic systems (A and B) may be provided from engine-driven, and electrical-driven pumps.
The switches on this panel control the source of hydraulic pressure.
Hydraulic system ‘A’ may be sourced from engine-driven pump #1, or electrical-driven pump #2, or both.
Hydraulic system ‘B’ may be sourced from engine-driven pump #2, or electrical-driven pump #1, or both.
23 11.
Cabin Pressurization This panel displays and controls the cabin pressurization.
The gauges on the left show the current cabin pressure, and the differential between the internal, and external pressures.
The FLT ALT rotary is used to manually set the anticipated peak altitude for the flight (in feet).
The LAND ALT rotary is used to manually set the landing altitude for the termination of the flight (in feet).
12.
Miscellaneous Rotary controls for the circuit breaker board lighting level, and overhead panel backlighting are located at the top of this panel.
The circuit breaker boards themselves are located on the back wall of the cockpit, behind the pilot and first-officer.
The EMERGENCY EXIT LIGHTS guarded switch controls the state of these lights.
When ARMED, the lights will illuminate automatically.
When ON, the lights are illuminated immediately.
The Flight attendant and ground personnel call buttons are located on this panel.
Also, the FASTEN SAFETY BELTS switch.
A rotary control exists at the bottom of the panel to control the windshield wipers.
24 Aft Overhead Panel
The aft overhead panel comprises a collection of smaller panels that manage the aircraft’s electrical, pneumatic, lighting, pressurization, engine start, and other systems.
Many of these were previously the domain of a flight engineer in the era of three- person flight crews.
Note: Not all of the functions contained within these panels are fully simulated in the X-Plane 737-800 model.
25 1.
Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT)
This panel is used to control the activation status of the Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT).
When in the (guarded) ARM position, the ELT will activate automatically in the event an impact is detected.
When in the ON position, the ELT activates immediately.
The annunciator is illuminated when the ELT is operating.
2. Dome Light This panel contains a single switch used to control the overhead cockpit ‘dome’ lighting.
26 3.
Audio Control
This panels controls the active mic, and active audio source.
The buttons along the top of the panel activate or deactivate the associated mics.
For example, clicking the VHF1 button to ON will activate the mic connected to the VHF 1 (pilot-side) radio.
The illuminated ‘rotaries’ below the buttons behave as toggle switches, and are used to activate, or deactivate the associated audio source.
For example, clicking the toggle below the VHF1 button will activate audio from the VHF 1 (pilot-side) radio.
4. Electronic Engine Control (EEC)
This panel controls the Electronic Engine Control system mode.
The ‘Engine Control’ annunciators illuminate when a malfunction is detected in the electronic engine control system, or the flight conditions data required by this system is compromised.
The EEC buttons provide control over the Electronic Engine Control system.
When ON is selected, this engages NORMAL mode – the EEC uses the current flight conditions (temperature, pressure and other data) to protect from exceeding the redline value for N1 (the low- pressure compressor fan).
In ALTN (alternate) mode, the EEC uses the last valid flight conditions (before becoming compromised) to accomplish this task.
‘Reverser’ annunciators illuminate temporarily when the thrust-reverser retracts back to the stowed position.
The annunciates illuminate permanently when a malfunction in the thrust- reversers is detected.
27 5.
Flight Recorder
This panel controls the flight data recorder.
When in the NORMAL (guarded) position, the flight recorder operates anytime the engines are running.
When in the TEST position, the flight recorder operates regardless of engine status.
6.
Oxygen
The CREW OXYGEN gauge indicates the pressure available in the crew oxygen cylinder, which provides supplemental oxygen in the event of a pressurization failure.
The annunciator illuminates if the passenger supplemental oxygen system has deployed.
The PASSENGER OXYGEN guarded switch has two modes – NORMAL (supplemental oxygen system deploys automatically) and ON (supplemental oxygen system deploys immediately).
7. Redundant Landing Gear Annunciators A separate set of annunciators that indicate the status of the landing gear - to provide redundancy in the event the primary annunciators (on the main instrument panel) fail.
28 Primary Instrument Panels Electronic Attitude Director Indicator (EADI)
This is the left LCD panel in the avionics cluster.
The EADI displays the attitude of the aircraft relative to the horizon, and the altitude (above sea level) - via the scale on the right.
The attitude display informs the pilot whether the aircraft is flying straight, or turning, and whether the aircraft is climbing, or descending.
This information is crucial in “instrument conditions” - when the outside horizon is not visible.
The EADI also displays localizer and glideslope deviation, when coupled to an ILS approach.
The EADI is covered in detail in a separate chapter: Electronic Attitude Director Indicator (EADI) Components 29 Electronic Horizontal Situation Indicator (EHSI)
This is the right LCD panel in the avionics cluster.
The EHSI displays the aircraft’s position & (magnetic) heading.
The display is presented in a plan view, as if looking down at the aircraft from directly above.
If a flight plan has been input (using the FMS), this panel also displays the aircraft’s position relative to the desired track.
The EHSI is covered in detail in a separate chapter: Electronic Horizontal Situation Indicator (EHSI) Components Backup EADI/EHSI This instrument provides redundancy in the event of a failure of the primary EADI and EHSI and combines the functions of both into a single unit.
The backup EADI/EHSI is powered by a separate electrical source.
30 Instrument Lighting Control Panel
This panel contains a series of rotary controls that adjust the instrument lighting.
MAIN PANEL controls the backlighting to the upper and lower instrument panels.
UPPER DU controls the brightness of the upper-center multi-function display unit (See: xxx).
LOWER DU controls the brightness of the lower-center multi-function display unit (See: xxx).
BACKGROUND controls the brightness of the lower instrument panel flood lighting.

General information about flight plans is available on Wikipedia at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_planning Flight plans can be generated by onboard computers if the aircraft is suitably equipped.
If not, simulation pilots may elect to use an online flight planner.
A web search for the phrase “Flight Planner” will yield a great many options, many of which are free services.
A good online flight planner will utilize the origin and destination airports, together with the aircraft type and equipment, the weather conditions, the chosen cruise altitude, known restrictions along the route, current NOTAMS, and other factors to generate a suitable flight plan.
The waypoints incorporated into the flight plan can be subsequently input into the aircraft’s Flight Management Computer (FMS), or Global Positioning System (GPS).
Some online flight planners provide the option to save the plan as an X-Plane compatible file, with an ‘fms’ extension.
A saved flight plan can be loaded into the GPS or Flight Management Computer unit featured in the B737-800.
It is recommended the pilot generate a flight plan for the chosen route before using the FMS or GPS units.
Instructions for operating the Laminar Research FMS and GPS units can be found in separate (dedicated) manuals.
56 Fuel Calculation Note: All calculations here are based on the X-Plane B737-800, and NOT the real-life B737-800.
Differences may exist.

Setting the Weight, Balance and Fuel in X-Plane After calculating your fuel requirements (see Fuel Calculation) and referencing the Load Sheet Tables, you are ready to configure the weight, balance and fuel for your upcoming flight.
Select the B737-800 from the flight menu, and click on the ‘Customize’ button, followed by the ‘Weight, Balance & Fuel’ button.
Now input the Center of Gravity, Payload Weight, Fuel Weight (Fuel Tank 1) and Fuel Weight (Fuel Tank 2) and Fuel Weight (Fuel Tank 3).
The example below is for the scenario highlighted in blue in the Load Sheet Tables.

Checklists The following check lists are designed with the convenience of the simulation pilot in mind and customized to the X-Plane B737-800 aircraft.
These differ from those of the real aircraft.
Pre-Flight Exterior Inspection A Pre-Flight Inspection should always precede flight in any aircraft.
The purpose of this inspection is to ensure the aircraft is in a state of readiness for the upcoming flight.
In X-Plane, a pre-flight inspection is not merely undertaken to simulate reality, but does in fact have real purpose, because the control surfaces of the aircraft interact directly with the airflow over and around them, just as in real life.
As such, correct movement of all control surfaces is necessary for normal flight.
Hold roll axis at full deflection.
Visually check corresponding movement of ailerons and speed-brakes.
64 Hold pitch axis at full deflection.
Visually check corresponding movement of elevators.
Hold yaw axis at full deflection.
Visually check corresponding movement of rudder.
65 Cold and Dark to Engine Start

### Summary ###
1 X-Plane 11 Boeing 737-800 Pilot’s Operating Manual Author: Julian Lockwood (julian@x-plane.com) Copyright: Laminar Research 2018 Disclaimer The information contained in this document is for simulation use only, within the X-Plane flight simulator. Flight Controls ................................................................................................................................. 18 2. Transfer ........................................................................................................................................... 19 4. Pneumatics ...................................................................................................................................... 22 10. A slightly larger model 200 followed in 1967, with increased thrust to compensate for additional weight. Modifications to the landing gear to incorporate the larger engines was required. The ‘Classics’ were larger, quieter and more economical, and also featured EFIS CRT avionics, replacing conventional instrumentation. The MAX variants offer four lengths, with options for 138 to 230 seats and a range of between 3,215 and 3,825 nautical miles. Empty Operating Weight ----------------------------------------- 91,700 lbs. / 1,635 m Range ----------------------------------------- 4,000 nm Service Ceiling ----------------------------------------- 41,000 ft. / When you “fly” an airplane in X- Plane, there are no artificial rules in place to govern how the aircraft behaves. Your control inputs move the control surfaces of the aircraft, and these interact with the virtual flow of air around it. As such, you may consider that you are really flying the aircraft. Checklists are presented later in this document (with modifications to suit this specific simulation platform and model). Use the assigned button/key to toggle the yoke view as required. This will have no effect on the yoke operation. Toggle and Rocker switches are operated with a single click of the mouse. A small white arrow is displayed to confirm the intended direction. More information is available in the X-Plane Desktop Manual. The same can be accomplished using the mouse wheel - if one is present on your device. This indicates that you are ready to rotate the control counter-clockwise. This is discussed in greater detail later in the guide. The B737-800 is equipped with Yokes, for roll and pitch control. 15 The B737-800 is equipped with a Flap lever, which controls the deployment of the flaps for takeoff and landing. To simulate this, assign a peripheral lever to the “Flaps” property in X-Plane. . Forward Overhead Panel The forward overhead panel comprises a collection of smaller panels that manage the aircraft’s electrical, pneumatic, lighting, pressurization, engine start, and other systems. Many of these were previously the domain of a flight engineer in the era of three- person flight crews. Note: Not all of the functions contained within these panels are fully simulated in the X-Plane 737-800 model. If either Nav Radio receiver / Inertial Reference System / Flight Management Computer fails, the associated control switches on this panel may be used to transfer the remaining (good) system to both pilot and first-officer in unison. The SOURCE Rotary is used on the ground for maintenance purposes. The CONTROL PANEL Rotary manually switches control of left and right-side displays to a single EFIS control panel. BAT - forces manual transfer to the standby electrical buses. The APU GEN 1 and APU GEN 2 switches activate the Auxiliary Power Unit electrical generators. Fuel This panel controls the fuel flow and fuel pumps. When open, either of the engines may source fuel from any tank. The anti-collision lights are controlled by the switches at the right side of this panel. Temperature Control This panel monitors and controls the cabin temperature. The pneumatic system provides air for engine starting, air conditioning packs and the wing anti- ice boots. Hydraulic system ‘B’ may be sourced from engine-driven pump #2, or electrical-driven pump #1, or both. The circuit breaker boards themselves are located on the back wall of the cockpit, behind the pilot and first-officer. When ON, the lights are illuminated immediately. The Flight attendant and ground personnel call buttons are located on this panel. When in the (guarded) ARM position, the ELT will activate automatically in the event an impact is detected. For example, clicking the toggle below the VHF1 button will activate audio from the VHF 1 (pilot-side) radio. When ON is selected, this engages NORMAL mode – the EEC uses the current flight conditions (temperature, pressure and other data) to protect from exceeding the redline value for N1 (the low- pressure compressor fan). Redundant Landing Gear Annunciators A separate set of annunciators that indicate the status of the landing gear - to provide redundancy in the event the primary annunciators (on the main instrument panel) fail. The EHSI displays the aircraft’s position & (magnetic) heading. MAIN PANEL controls the backlighting to the upper and lower instrument panels. LOWER DU controls the brightness of the lower-center multi-function display unit (See: xxx). Red indicators are warnings, amber indicators are cautions, and green indicators are for information. Every annunciator light on this panel may be illuminated by moving the LIGHTS switch to TEST. A/P P/RST: Auto-pilot caution or warning. FMC P/RST: Flight Management Computer caution or warning. TAKEOFF CONFIG: Takeoff configuration caution or warning. SPEED BRAKE ARMED: Automatic speed-brake deployment is armed for landing. 2 FMC SPD Aircraft speed is controlled by the FMC (Flight Management Computer) 3 LNAV LNAV (Lateral Navigation Mode) engaged. 33 6 Altitude Scale 7 Flight Director Horizontal Deviation Bar When the aircraft is following a flight-plan, or according to a navigation aid, this bar informs the pilot to climb, or descend, to intercept the desired altitude. MAP: Places the EHSI display in ‘MAP’ mode. The location of the aircraft is presented at the bottom of the screen, and the map incorporates airports, navigation aids and waypoints (within the selected range) that are ahead of, and 45 degrees either side of, this position. 38 Center Panel Multi-Function Panel The N1 SET rotary controls the maximum throttle setting (as a percentage of N1) that may be used by the auto-throttle in TOGA (Take-Off and Go Around) situations. 42 FMS Control Display Units (CDUs) See the (separate) X-Plane 11 Flight Management System (FMS) Manual for comprehensive instructions in relation to the function and operation of the Flight Management System installed in this aircraft. Up: Deployed to the maximum position for ground use. Flap Lever The Flap Lever operates the wing flaps. Control panels are located on either side of the center console, for access by pilot and first-officer. Use the toggle switch located between the frequency displays to select the active frequency (indicated by a green light) Use the rotary controls below each of the frequency displays to change the frequency. The outer-rotary changes the numeric value, and the inner-rotary changes the decimal value. Use the right outer-rotary control to adjust the code in units of 10. Trim This panel features trim adjustments for roll and yaw. You may choose to map a joystick control to this function). 3 C/O Toggle Toggles the IAS / MACH display units between Knots and Mach-number 4 IAS / MACH Display and Rotary When used in conjunction with the Speed Button, and Auto-Throttle, the autopilot will govern the speed according to this value. Use the Rotary Control inner ring to adjust the heading. The autopilot will follow the lateral components of your flight plan. The flight-crew can manually fly the aircraft according to the flight plan - by aligning the attitude indicator with the Flight Director pitch and bank command bars. 14 VS Button Click this button to engage Vertical Speed Mode. Used in conjunction with the auto-throttle, the autopilot will govern the rate of ascent, or descent, according to the value indicated by the Vertical Speed Display. 16 VOR / LOC Button Click this button to engage VOR or Localizer Mode. The autopilot will steer according to the Heading Display / EHSI heading bug. It is recommended the pilot generate a flight plan for the chosen route before using the FMS or GPS units. These tables do not include ground operations. PAX Fwd PAX Mid PAX Aft Cargo Fwd Cargo Aft Payload (lbs.) These differ from those of the real aircraft. The purpose of this inspection is to ensure the aircraft is in a state of readiness for the upcoming flight. As such, correct movement of all control surfaces is necessary for normal flight. Visually check corresponding movement of elevators. Wait for Blue Light illumination on APU panel.
