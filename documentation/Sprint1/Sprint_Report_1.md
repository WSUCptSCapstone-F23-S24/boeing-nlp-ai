# Sprint 1 Report (8/21/23 - 10/5/23)

## What's New (User Facing)
Our Understanding of the Project
 * Use NLP model to summarize large documents
 * Implement OpenAI's ChatGPT API
 * Use previous Capstone's as inspiration

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
We met up weekly with our mentors and decided on a day and time we could all meet regularly (Tuesdays @ 12pm). We also completed the Solutions Approach section of our project document. We added weekly client meeting notes in a folder on GitHub along with some starting files, LICENSE.txt and a readme for the repo.

## Unfinished Work
 * Organizing and understanding previous Capstones
