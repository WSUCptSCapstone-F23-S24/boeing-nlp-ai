# Sprint 5 Report (2/3/24 - 3/2/24)

## What's New (User Facing)
 * More User Interaction
 * Web application
 * Unknown characters are parsed out

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
We continued to meet weekly with our Boeing mentors on Tuesdays @ 2:30pm, and have continued the development process of our project. We have decided to also meet weekly with just our team on Mondays @ 5:30pm to make sure everyone is on track. We have encorporated Asana into our project strategy. We have enhanced the user experience by adding more interaction and a web application.

## Unfinished Work
* Improve Summary Generation
Having a model to generate a more accurate summary would be ideal -- the summary is better, but could be improved.
* Integrate ChatGPT API
Was more complex than anticipated, will need to gain more insight.
