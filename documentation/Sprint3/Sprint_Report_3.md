# Sprint 3 Report (11/5/23 - 12/5/23)

## What's New (User Facing)
 * Utilized our Learning and Resume Parser from Sprint 2 to development of our NLP model
 * Added feature to search through file path
 * Developed very basic command-line UI
 * Developed very basic summary generator
 * Added support for .txt and PDFs

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
We continued to meet weekly with our Boeing mentors on Tuesdays and have started the development process of our project. We developed a command-line document processing tool supporting both PDF and text files. Integrated SpaCy models dynamically based on document size. Made plans for next semester and work to do over break.

## Unfinished Work
* Optimization of Document Parser
Having a model to generate a more accurate summary would be ideal. Due to time constraints and work-load, I was unable to optimize this program.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * Development of a Basic foundation for our prototype (Document Parser, File Search GUI, Command-line UI)
  * Meeting regularly with mentors and professor
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * Communication
   * Dividing up workload evenly
   * Creating issues in our repo 
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * Communicating with team members more often
   * Implementing ChatGPT with our NLP model
   * Optimizing our NLP model
