# Sprint 6 Report (3/3/24 - 4/2/24)

## What's New (User Facing)
 * ChatGPT Generates Summary of Document
 * Timestamps and Progress Bar for Processing
 * PyTests
 * Rough Draft of Using LangChain to Split up long documents to process

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
We continued to meet weekly with our Boeing mentors on Tuesdays @ 2:30pm, and have continued the development process of our project. We have continued meet weekly with just our team on Mondays @ 5:30pm to make sure everyone is on track. We have encorporated Asana into our project strategy. We are in the works of implementing ChatGPT and adding additional testing for our final product.

## Unfinished Work
* Testing and QA
Will implement more robust and in-depth testing in next sprint.
* Integrate ChatGPT API
Was more complex than anticipated, will need to gain more insight. Will be using LangChain for this.
