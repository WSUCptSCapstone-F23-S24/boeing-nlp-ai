# Sprint 2 Report (10/5/23 - 11/5/23)

## What's New (User Facing)
 * Added 'Learning' folder as deliverable for Sprint 2
 * Created a Reasearch Paper that delves into SpaCy and its features
 * Created a Resume Parser using SpaCy

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
We continued to meet weekly with our Boeing mentors on Tuesdays and gained a better understanding of how to implement SpaCy in our project. We also completed the Testing and Acceptance Plans section of our project document. We gained access to all previous Capstones and reviewed them.

## Unfinished Work
* Develop NLP Model Prototype
Our mentors belived it best to start the coding process later this semester so we could have time to research and learn from the resources they provided.
To satisfy the criteria for Sprint 2, we developed a research project for ourselves and created a resume parser and research document on SpaCy, the NLP library we will be using for our prototype.
We plan to start the development process of our prototype from this moment forward.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * Understanding the full scope of the project
  * Developing side projects for SpaCy
  * Meeting regularly with mentors and professor
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * The development process of our prototype
   * Dividing up workload evenly
   * Creating issues in our repo 
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * Communicating with team members more often
   * Creating and utilizing branches in our GitHub repo instead of uploading directly to main
   * Starting to write code for our prototype
