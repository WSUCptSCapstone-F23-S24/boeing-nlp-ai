# Sprint 4 Report (12/5/23 - 2/2/24)

## What's New (User Facing)
 * Created custom named entity recognition model
 * Enhanced summary generator (BERT)
 * Added support for .txt and PDFs

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
We continued to meet weekly with our Boeing mentors on Tuesdays @ 2:30pm now, and have continued the development process of our project. We have decided to also meet weekly with just our team on Mondays @ 5:30pm to make sure everyone is on track. We have enhanced the accuracy of our parser and used custom labels specific to aircraft documents.

## Unfinished Work
* Optimization of Document Parser
Having a model to generate a more accurate summary would be ideal -- the summary is better, but could be improved.
