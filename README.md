# Conversational Aerospace NLP Model

## Project summary

### One-sentence description of the project

This project aims to create an internal Boeing ChatGPT, a conversational AI system, the gives Boeing stakeholders the ability to effortlessly summarize and comprehend large, complex technical documents.

### Additional information about the project

The Boeing NLP model will be your personal tool to navigate pilot operating handbooks, domain-specific documents, and much more. Within just a few keystrokes, you will be able to turn that 20-50 page document into a few paragraphs.

Our goal is to successfully create an NLP model that can accurately and efficiently summarize these documents to increase productivity of Boeing employees. A user should be able to input a PDF or Word document to have it be summarized by our program. We will also implement ChatGPT internally as your personal AI co-pilot to navigate these complex documents with you. This program is your key to unlocking unlimited aerospace knowledge, increasing productivity, and expanding innovation at Boeing.
